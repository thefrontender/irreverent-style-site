I have been thinking a lot lately about applying [pace layers](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2) to technology, particularly in the current climate of hype, where everything is declared a breakthrough (probably because slow, incremental progress toward stable, usable platforms is too 'boring')

Bjarnsason provides another example of software moving at the speed of fashion when its users need it to move slower, be more reliable, to learn *from* fashion (and either adopt or reject as appropriate) rather than to _be_ fashion.
