From [Simon Collison's first newsletter offering of the year](https://mailchi.mp/d3c3ef15d387/simon-collison-01), somehow (via a chain of links I am unable to rebuild even 5 minutes after first following them) to [Frank Chimero's thoughts on burnout](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/burnout-list/) where this line about the exhaustion that proceeds from overabundance resonated:

> A disease of abundance requires abstinence, not antidotes.

And thence to ['The Burnout Society' by Byung-Chul Han](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25725)
