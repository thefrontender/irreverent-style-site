On rolling your own tools/technology:

> Use an off the shelf tool until you break it, until you hit its edges, then look for a solution. If that solution requires you to build something, then you have permission to build it, but only building out just enough to solve your creative issue.
> â€” Craig Mod, [Roden Issue 050](https://craigmod.com/roden/050/)
