> A good tool is an invisible tool. By invisible, we mean that the tool does not intrude on your consciousness; you focus on the task, not the tool…Good tools enhance invisibility.
> …Unfortunately, our common metaphors for computer interaction lead us away from the invisible tool, and towards _making the tool the center of attention_.
> …magic is about psychology and salesmanship, and I believe a dangerous model for good design and productive technology. The proof is in the details—magic ignores them. Furthermore magic continues to glorify itself
